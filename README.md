#Explanations


Forcefield:
To get the basic forcefield effect, I used the rim lighting technique seen in class. This effect isn't enough, so I added in two other effects to bring the forcefield together.

The first effect being a scrolling texture, this was done by doing a simple texture application through the shader, and through C# code we can access the Offset property of said texture. Simply setting the x offset to the Time.time allowed us to have a scrolling texture on our forcefield!

The second effect is a little less noticable, but it simply lerps the color inside the rim lighting based on the distance from the camera. This effect adds in a nice transition from far away to closer.
